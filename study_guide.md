## Lab 1 Study Guide 

The lab will consist of the following topics, please brush up on them since this is a timed evaluation, and you will only have an hour.

### Part 1 Data Cleaning 

Textbook study guide: Python for Data Analysis Chapters 4, 6, and 7. This part of the lab will require you to load a dataset from a link, 
clean the data in a certain way using some constraints, and generate two distinct pandas dataframes. 

---

### Part 2 Numpy Calculation

Textbook study guide: Python for Data Analysis Chapters 4. This part of the lab will require you to take 2 columns from 2 different datasets and 
calculate a metric using both columns. Essentially this question is somewhat of a map-reduce problem. Revise your broadcasting, working with `np.array`, for-loops, and generally numpy skills. 

### Part 3 Distributional Characteristic Statistics

This part can be tackled 1 of 2 ways for full marks. You will be marked qualitatively, so the more analysis/justification you write the better off you will be. 
The last end conclusion will separate you from a 3 to a 4. There is a way to do this question without simulations. 

- Please review all week-1 lecture notes found here: [Notes](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1L1Kx8qoHCY3yjuYg2tE4W61xu79xG7lJ?usp=sharing) 
- Absolutely essential reading: 13.5.1 A Re-Sampling Approach to the p-Value [ISLR](https://hastie.su.domains/ISLR2/ISLRv2_website.pdf), Algorithm 13.3, we covered only half of this algorithm in class, with the remaining part would be to just compare your p-value to the distributions of re-sampled p-values, or calculate equation (13.12).

Useful functions for this question, `np.random.choice`. Try coding this algorithm up yourself! with different types of distributions, Gaussian, Generalized Hyperbolic, or Lognormal distributions. You can send me emails with code examples.
